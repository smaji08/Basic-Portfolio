                <p class="aboutme">I am Augustine Stella Maria. I live in Manchester, CT. Before moving to here in USA, I was in India for the most part of my life. I have done postgraduation in Computer Applications. During my time there in India, I worked from a process executive to a Medical transcriptionist to a Programmer. I am eager to continue my career in IT, especially in Web Development. I do believe the UCONN bootcamp will help me to kickstart my career.</p>

                <p class="aboutme">My <strong>social self</strong> sees myself as a quick learner. I always enjoyed working independently yet I am very comfortable working in a team too. I do communicate effectively.  If you ask my ex-colleagues/friends, they mostly will say I am good in digging out something positive even in difficult situations and that I am confident in expressing my views and am ready to help on any topic/area I am familiar with or good at.</p>
                        
                <p class="aboutme">My <strong>personal self</strong> loves people, food, and travel. I love cooking and baking! Also, I love to hike...only easy to moderate ones though :)</p>
